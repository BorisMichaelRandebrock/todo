# to do list

## About the Project

```
This todo list is a simple, but yet useful tool for the users task-management.

Although, for the moment it is still lacking the implementation for dates and times, it is already a very useful tool for the users to manage their tasks and dates and times should be implemented as future features.

Several users can use the same app, but each user has his own tasks and can only create, see, mark as done/undone & delete his own tasks through the supabase data-management setup.

The app is fully responsive for desktop and mobile devices.

## Project technologies

```

This todo list is a fullstack API project created with Vue.js, Quasar Framework, Pinia (state management) and Node (engine) technology in front end and Supabase in back.

The Supabase database is initially handling two databses: one for users and another for tasks.
At a later stage, the database will be updated to handle more tables, as there shall be several tables for different categories of tasks as shopping, grocer√≠es...

In order to enhance the user experience, it has used the Quasar-Dialog, for confirmation of the delete function, and Quasar-Notification for other user feedbacks like task uploads, deletes, logout...

The Quasar framework is the main responsible for the design of the app with its corresponding components and styles which than have been customized to fit the project needs.

```

## Vue.js

```

Vue.js has been chosen as it is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.
The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

This projects has been created in vue compositions API and it is a single page application.



```

## Quasar Framework

the Quasar Framework is a Vue.js based framework that allows you to build responsive Single Page Applications, Progressive Web Apps, Server-Side Rendered Apps, Hybrid Mobile Apps and Electron Apps, all using the same codebase, powered with Vue.js. It offers a state of the art Store, Router, which is why it seemed to be the good alternative for this prooject.

```

### Pinia

```
The Pinia state management is the responsible for the data handling and the communication between the components.

It has been the obvious choice for this project as it is a very light and easy to use state management library for Vue.js.
