# to-do list

## About the Project
<img src="/public/todo-simulation.gif" width="250" align="right" alt="simulation of todo app"/>

This to-do list is a simple, yet useful tool for the users task-management.

Several users can use the same app, but each user has his own, private tasks and can only create, see, mark as done/undone & delete his own tasks through the supabase data-management setup.

The app is a CRUD, fully responsive SPA for desktop and mobile devices.

## Project technologies

This todo list is a fullstack API SPA-project created with Vue.js and Quasar Frameworks, Pinia, Vite and Node technology in front-end and with Supabase in back-end and as DB.

The Supabase database is currently handling four databases: one for the users Auth (authentification and authorization) and the other three for the tasks, shopping- and drugstore-items.

Implementation of additional tables is not presenting any difficulties.

In order to enhance the user experience the feedback to the user is handled through the Quasar-Dialog for user confirmations of the delete function, and Quasar-Notify for other user notifications like task-uploads, -deletes, -logout...

The Quasar framework is the main responsible for the design of the app with its corresponding components and styles which than have been customized to fit the projects needs.

## Vue.js

Vue.js has been chosen as it is a progressive and very flexible framework for building user interfaces.
The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

This projects has been created in Vue composition API and it is a Single Page Application.

## Quasar Framework

The Quasar Framework is a Vue.js based framework that allows to build responsive Single Page Applications, Progressive Web Apps, Server-Side Rendered Apps, Hybrid Mobile Apps and Electron Apps, all using the same codebase, powered with Vue.js. It offers a state of the art Store, Router, which is why it seemed to be a good option to complement this project and enable a future expansion from SPA to PWA.

## Pinia

The Pinia state management is the responsible for the data handling and the communication between the components.

For me it seemed to be the obvious choice for this project as it is a very light and easy to use state management library for Vue.js and created for and by the Vue creators team.
